        <p>Although much of the green infrastructure in the Bronx is concentrated north of the Bronx Park, some green infrastructure components are strewn throughout Hunts Point, Port Morris, and Mott Haven. Click on the dots to learn about some of these locations and how they contribute to stormwater retention and water health. A full map of the DEP's green infrastructure in the city can be found <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/mapviewer/index.html?webmap=a3763a30d4ae459199dd01d4521d9939">here.</a> </p>

                    <h3>St. Mary's Park</h3>
                    <p>St. Mary's Park has multiple green infrastructure installations: a cistern, green roof, and a rain garden. Rain gardens are installed all across the city, and are one of the more recognizable and aesthetically appealing types of green infrastructure. These gardens line the sidewalks (instead of the roads, as greenstreets do), and absorb stormwater into a layer of soil.</p>

                        <h3>Bruckner Boulevard</h3>
                        <p>Three greenstreets are installed at Bruckner Boulevard, north of Port Morris. The Department of Environmental Protection has a Greenstreets Program that installs these spaces. Stormwater greenstreets bring greenery to planted areas of roads in the city, allowing for stormwater to gather and be retained. </p>

                            <p>Multiple concrete topped infiltration basins are located across Hunts Point. These are less aesthetically appealing green infrastructure projects; they absorb stormwater and retain, then absorb it in a container beneath the surface.</p>

                                <p>The SoBro green roof is one of multiple in the South Bronx. Green roofs are planted rooftops with drainage space beneath the vegetation. Blue roofs are similar structures that absorb stormwater but are not planted.<xxxxxxx/p>
